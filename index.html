        <div class="option">Welcome to my DnD Character Builder! The most important thing to note is that the 
            first 5 questions are the MOST IMPORTANT. Take your time on them, they all have words in all 
            CAPS that should be read carefully. On those questions and all that follows, it is much better to
            select no answer than it is to select an answer that you don't agree with. All questions can be 
            left blank but obviously providing little to no info will give odd results.</div>
