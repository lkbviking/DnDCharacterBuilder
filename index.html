        <p class="option">The most important thing to note is that the first 4 questions are weighted 
            MUCH HIGHER than the rest. Take your time on them, they all have words in all CAPS that should be 
            read carefully. On those questions and all that follows, it is much better to select the "I don't 
            care" or "None of the above" options than it is to select an answer that you don't agree with. 
            "Select All That Apply" questions are distinguished by having checkboxes (difference shown below).
            If it is a "Select All That Apply" question, you may select none of the options and doing so will
            give you a better result than picking one or more inaccurate options.
