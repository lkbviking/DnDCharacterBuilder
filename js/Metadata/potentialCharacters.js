One moment healing your wounded backline and the next unleashing a flurry of blows upon the backline of the enemy. As you move your voice rises in an inspiring chant, encouraging your comrades and boosting their morale. Your bardic magic filling the air. Your allies are invincible with you by their side and your enemies fall at your hands. All this, and you don\'t even wield weapons or armor, it just wouldn\'t be fair.')

Font of Inspiration allows you to use Bardic Inspiration every turn without running out of uses while Agile Strikes allows these Bardic Inspiration uses to also grant you a free unarmed attack. Using your bardic inspiration as a bonus action every turn will allow you to constantly hand out the die while also dishing out punches to the enemies, all without using your action which can be saved for a powerful spell or more punches.')
